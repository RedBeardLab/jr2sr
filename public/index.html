<div class="paragraph">
<p>Junior 2 Senior is a technical course where I unload all my knowledge for younger computer engineers that want to speed up their career path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to provide all the necessary notions and mental models to work around problems for people to be hired in high-tech companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The course is based only on fundamental concepts. We will focus only on those concepts that were important 20 years ago, are important now, and will be important for at least the next 20 years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will cover very broad topics without going too deep into any, there are already a lot of resources, references and articles to dive deep into all the topics we will cover. The purpose of this publication is to uncover organically all the small things that senior computer engineers should know. It is left to the reader to decide which topic explores further and when.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people will need to understand better the internals of compilers, while for others it would be more beneficial to study how the sorting inside a database works. In this course, we will explore both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will suggest some exercises to help you learn by doing. Making sure that you understand the main ideas down to the important details.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_it_is_about">What it is about</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The course is about getting you up to speed with all those topics that are fundamental for computer engineers but to which younger engineers might have not been exposed yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is about making sure you have all the notion to go above expectations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is about overcoming imposter syndrome having studied and understood those fundamental topics on which everything else is based.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the topics covered are much deeper than what could be cover, but it will be up to the reader to keep digging for what it is more interesting.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_a_different_course">A different course</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technical books are usually about a specific topic, say "Graphical programming with GPU".
Those kinds of books and courses go extremely deeply about the specific topic, teaching all the important and not so important bits.
Those resources are fundamental if you are specializing in a particular field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This course is different, it is about exposing you to the fundamental concepts that any senior engineer should know.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_structure">Structure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The course is composed of two-part.</p>

<li>
<p>A book</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A community</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book is digital and you will have access to all the versions and the errata. <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/junior2senior">It is in presale here.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The community is about sharing solution with the exercises, clarify part of the books that are not clear, ask further questions, suggest new topics, and helping each other.
It will also be possible to ask support during technical interview preparation.
The community is still not open.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_outline">Outline</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The outline of the book is in progress, new topics will be added and stuff will be moved.</p>

        Understanding the concept of processes is fundamental when working with computers.
 Most articles tackle the issue from a quite shallow perspective or the wrong point of view. We will try to study them from what I believe is the most useful point of view for a senior computer engineer.
   What processes are Processes are a computational unit.
 This definition is neither precise nor completely correct, but it helps in understanding.

        In the first article, we describe what is a web/HTTP request. Requests are directed toward a host and a port.
 The port is defined by the protocol, HTTP goes to port 80, HTTPS goes to 443. The host is defined by the request as a string.
 A possible host is "google.com" another is "facebook.com".
 However, packets are routed over the internet using IP addresses, numbers, while hosts are strings.

        Today I fixed a minor bug in our production code.
 The software is written in Go(lang) and makes extensive use of the defer statement.
 The defer statement, take a function invocation and run it after the current function returns.
 They are very handy for clean-up tasks. A classical example is the acquisition of a lock. Or closing a file.
 Without defer you would get your resource at the beginning of the function, use it, and then clean-up.

        Databases are fundamental in all web application, website, API, CRUD.
 Lately, new software around databases starts to blossom.
 An example is GraphQL.
 It provides a more handy, mobile-friendly, interface to access data. Often on top of classical databases.
 New tools don&#8217;t allow us to skip the underneath fundamental knowledge. But they force us to understand how things work under the hood much deeper.
 Now, it is even more important to understand why some queries are slow and why some are fast.

        The web and internet as a large are fundamental for today&#8217;s world, but how does it work under the hood?
 In this article, we will talk about HTTP requests that are the fundamentals blocks that make the modern web possible.
 We will explore how tools like Python requests or Ruby Net::HTTP or again the Go package net/http or any other library that you may use in any other language works.
