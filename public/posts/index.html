        In the first article, we describe what is a web/HTTP request. Requests are directed toward a host and a port.
 The port is defined by the protocol, HTTP goes to port 80, HTTPS goes to 443. The host is defined by the request as a string.
 A possible host is "google.com" another is "facebook.com".
 However, packets are routed over the internet using IP addresses, numbers, while hosts are strings.

        Today I fixed a minor bug in our production code.
 The software is written in Go(lang) and makes extensive use of the defer statement.
 The defer statement, take a function invocation and run it after the current function returns.
 They are very handy for clean-up tasks. A classical example is the acquisition of a lock. Or closing a file.
 Without defer you would get your resource at the beginning of the function, use it, and then clean-up.

        Databases are fundamental in all web application, website, API, CRUD.
 Lately, new software around databases starts to blossom.
 An example is GraphQL.
 It provides a more handy, mobile-friendly, interface to access data. Often on top of classical databases.
 New tools don&#8217;t allow us to skip the underneath fundamental knowledge. But they force us to understand how things work under the hood much deeper.
 Now, it is even more important to understand why some queries are slow and why some are fast.

        The web and internet as a large are fundamental for today&#8217;s world, but how does it work under the hood?
 In this article, we will talk about HTTP requests that are the fundamentals blocks that make the modern web possible.
 We will explore how tools like Python requests or Ruby Net::HTTP or again the Go package net/http or any other library that you may use in any other language works.

        Junior 2 Senior is a technical course where I unload all my knowledge for younger computer engineers that want to speed up their career path.
 The goal is to provide all the necessary notions and mental models to work around problems for people to be hired in high-tech companies.
 The course is based only on fundamental concepts. We will focus only on those concepts that were important 20 years ago, are important now, and will be important for at least the next 20 years.
